# Individual Project Proposal

Over the course of this semester, you will be working in groups of 3 to develop a Full Stack Web Application that you will demo at the end of the semester on _Demo Night_ (in Mid-December).

Before we form groups, I would like each of you to come up with an individual proposal for a project that fits at least one of the following criteria. (Once you have formed teams, you will discuss, choose, and refine your proposals further. Each team will develop a single application.)

## Project Criteria

Modern full stack applications (think Facebook/Gmail) are quite complex and deliver many features and services, but they typically start out as much smaller efforts. For your project proposals, come up with ideas that can roughly fit into one of the following 4 platform categories of full stack applications (_These are not the only categories for applications by the way, just the most common. In fact many businesses and applications have features that cross multiple categories_).

1) **Communication platforms:** These are among the hardest to build. They allow users to sign up and share usernames to communicate via direct messages or group messages in real time. Much like text messaging or calling (voice and/or video). _Examples:_
    - Slack
    - WhatsApp
    - WeChat
    - Hangouts
    - Skype

2) **Marketplace or exchange platforms:** This category makes physical or digital goods (including services) available for sale or trade. Either from a central seller that maintains an inventory or by allowing users to post the inventory. _Examples:_
    - Amazon
    - eBay
    - Etsy
    - Shoppify
    - Fiver

3) **Social media platforms:** These allow users to create "friend" networks and share content (text, image, and video postings) in a public or semi-private way. _Examples:_
    - Facebook
    - Snapchat
    - Instagram
    - Twitter
    - LinkedIn

4) **Content creation and distribution platforms:** These are the core platforms for news and blog sites. They allow a limited group of content creator users to create and edit content that is distributed to consumers of the content. _Examples:_
    - WordPress
    - Drupal
    - Medium
    - Tumblr
    - Photoshop (online)
    - Google Docs/Office 360
    - Netflix
    - Youtube


If you feel your project idea does not fit one of these platform categories, then clearly define the category and provide examples for approval.

### Example project:

**You can't use this project!**

Four years ago, CTP students built an application called the **"Community Tool Sharing site"**. The application allowed members of a community (such as a building or town) to post tools they had available for sharing, such as Drill's, Ladders, Wrenches, etc. Other members of the community could request to borrow the tool, which would then be marked as unavailable, and would be marked available upon return. This site allowed the community to make the best use of tools each member owned but rarely used, while not having to buy expensive tools they needed for one-off jobs.


## Project Proposal Requirements

Propose your own project idea with the following information:

1) **Project Name**
2) **Student Name**
3) **Executive summary (1-2 paragraphs)**
    - Describe your full stack web application idea. Answer the following questions to help you describe your application idea:
        + What does the application do?
        + What is the motivation for your application?
        + Who would use this application?
        + Is there a _need_ or _want_ in the market that it fulfills (_does not have to be a for-profit, or paid need_)?
        + Are there similar applications and/or competitors available now? How does your idea differ? or why is there a need for a competitor?
