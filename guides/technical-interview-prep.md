## The technical interview process

After you apply to a job, with an updated technical resume, companies that review and select your resume will begin contacting you to schedule interviews. While every company is different the process will roughly match the following:

- **Screening**
    + The first interview is used as a baseline to determine if you make it to the next round of multiple interviews.
    + The screener may take the following forms
        * Online coding challenge (HackerRank like platforms)
        * Phone call plus Google Doc
            - you will code and talk with interviewer
        * Phone call only
            - to discuss your resume, experience, and/or basic technical knowledge
- **Onsite / Multiple Interviews**
    + After the screener you will have ~3-5 interviews
        * 1 interview with Tech Lead/Management on team fit
        * 1 interview with engineer on System Design
        * 1-3 interviews with engineers on one or more of the following topics
            - Data Structure / Algorithms
            - System Design
            - Specific Technologies
    + Each interview will last ~45 minutes
    + The question styles are described in the next section (Exam/Q&A, Whiteboarding, or Code Review).
- **Decision**
    + You will then receive an offer (talk with your career coaches about negotiating!)
    + or you may have follow up conversations with HR and Team Leads to find right team/fit.


### Interview question styles

The style of interview questions roughly fit into the following 3 categories:

- **Exam / Q & A**
    + In this type of interview your knowledge of a specific language and libraries may be tested. (Verbally or Written)
    + Your previous projects and experience may be discussed
        * _It is important that you have a clear narrative of the development of any project_.
    + Behavioral questions may be asked
- **Whiteboarding**
    + In this type of interview you are asked to code on a whiteboard, paper, or Google Doc.
        * There is no compiler or syntax highlighting
        * The purpose is to see your thinking and planning process
        * Understand the depth of your knowledge
        * Determine your communication skills
    + The types of questions can be:
        * Data Structures / Algorithms / System Design
- **Take home project and code review**
    + In this type of interview, you are given an assignment to complete ahead of time
        * You _should_ be provided clear instructions and minimum specs. 
        * You _may_ be provided starter code.
        * You are given between 2-7 days to complete (manage expectation)
    + If your submission is approved you will be called in for a code review with an engineer. Be prepared to walk the engineer through your project and to discuss the following:
        * Your design decisions
        * Tradeoffs you made and why
        * Bugs that you or interviewer found
        * Plan for continuing
        * Considerations for improving security, performance, usability, etc...
    + After this review you may be asked to code an entirely new feature or project.
    + **Note:** This is becoming a more popular form of interview, especially for front-end and mobile development roles.


### What do employers want?

When preparing for the technical interview it is important that you research the companies particular style of tech interviews. Whether you are talking to a person or not, it is important that you _'talk out'_ your thinking, in an automated computer test this could be done with brief comments in your code and your naming convention. 

Put yourself in the interviewers shoes: what would _you_ like in an employee?

- Thought Process
    + Define the problem first
    + Find edge cases
    + Evaluate solution strategies
        * How do you eliminate/pick a strategy
    + Code organization and whiteboard/time use
- Passion
- Clear Communication
    + Verbal
    + Code
- Confidence
    + to know when you're right and why
    + to know when you're wrong and why
- Cultural Fit
    + Body Language
    + Confidence
- Domain knowledge
    + For tech specific roles, proficiency in specific tech is required

### Coding Challenges: What should I know?

See these slides on [Technical Interview Best Practices](tech-interview-best-practices.pdf) for tips on acing the coding challenge. 

## Resources

A popular resource for preparing for tech interviews is the book _'Cracking the Code Interview'_ by Gayle Laakmann McDowell. Below are some (of the many) videos available based on the book and from the author. You can adapt and apply the strategies in any style of interview.

### Coding Challenge Practice

For coding challenge practice I recommend the following resources (_but do them on a whiteboard or paper before you type it into the computer_):

- https://leetcode.com/
    + An excellent resource of free problems. Clearly written descriptions.
- https://www.hackerrank.com/
    + A popular platform that companies use, _get to know it!_ The descriptions are _verbose_ and take some getting used to.
- https://projecteuler.net/
    + Mostly mathematical questions. Useful if you're looking for more computationally leaning work.
